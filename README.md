# SmartGrow FastAPI Backend
Persist data using Firebase Firestore. Backend server run on FastAPI, deployed on Render.

This is the backend server for the SmartGrow system. It is a FastAPI application designed to receive data from IoT devices, store it in Firebase Firestore, and expose a REST API for web and mobile team to consume.

## üåê Server Address
https://test-server-owq2.onrender.com

## üå± Features

- **Plant API:** Logic to create a plant in the system, and get plant data.
- **Sensor API:** Logic to submit sensor data (moisture, temperature, light, humidity) from ESP32, and get sensor data for real-time monitoring.
- **Action Log API:** Logic to record action logs (water, light, fan), either downstream from ESP32 actuator control, or upstream by user manual control.
- **User API:** Logic to register a user, and get user profile settings.
- **API Docs:**: Swagger UI docs for quick reference, available at <server-address>/docs.
- **Caching:** Utilize LRU cache with time-to-live (TTL) of 60 seconds to store frequently accessed data, to reduce Firestore read document limit.
- **MQTT service:** Publish and subscribe (Pub/Sub) to MQTT broker for actuator control command.
- **Ping service:** Ping to server root endpoint every 10 minutes to keep it running 24/7, as Render free plan spins down server afer 15 minutes without receiving inbound traffic.
- **Data Cleanup service:** Daily clean up sensor and action logs prior to last one week (e.g. today Friday, delete all logs prior to last Friday), to optimize Firestore data storage limit.
